            <h1>I received a job offer min-course, and the subject I learned were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's worth.</h1>
            <p>"I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free into course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and the most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup." </p>

            <h1>Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h1>
            <p>"Before joining the bootcamp, I;ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multipe offers. 100% recommend!" </p>
